He surmises that the list of addresses Jack put into the computer while storing the Ancient data were Ancient outposts in temporal order. Thus the last of the addresses should be the \"City of the Lost\". SG-1 visits the planet and happens upon the nomadic people, now inhabiting the ruins of the Ancient city. There they find Daniel, but discover his memory is gone. They must recover his memories in order to discover the secret to defeating Anubis.",
