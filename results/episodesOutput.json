O'Neill would very much like to salvage the ship despite Jacob's warnings that it could be a Trojan horse.

Rather than follow O'Neill's orders, Felger and another scientist, Simon Coombs, transport themselves up to the Goa'uld ship. What the scientists don't know is that SG-1's capture is a ruse to allow Khonsu, who is actually a Tok'ra, to pass on information.

The problem is that the Replicators have turned off the device and the Asgard want SG-1 to go in and activate it.
