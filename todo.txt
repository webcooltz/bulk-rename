todo
-add it all in one function, detailed log file with error messages and re-runs available
-add failed metadata episode objects to another file where it guesses what the data should be

add error handling
-create log file
-when video fails (due to name):
    -skip video, add to failed video file 
-when naming fails (diff names or characters)
    -try to add more ability to fix names automatically
    -add an error message

next debug
-find out why every function is skipping to the end and not doing anything
-find the difference between mission creep and other working episodes
-episodes that broke:
    -season 1: MP4 - 3, 6, 9-10, 13, 15, 17-18, 20
    -season 1: MKV - 3, 6, 9-10, 13, 15, 17-18, 20

test cases
-test one of the broken only -- erase all other episodes from the json file
    -result: 3 was still broken
    -result: 6 still broken
-test episode 1 alone
    -result: works
-see the diff between episode objects
    -result: same
-see the diff between episode metadata
    -result: same
-see the diff between episode file size
    -result: about the same
-see the diff between episode format
    -result: same
-take out title meta tag
    -result: it works for video s1 e6 - the fix

to-do debug
-check if cleanvid app changes metadata -- if i would need to clean my movies before this
